## Evaluating RISC Processors  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary goal of this presentation is to discuss the benefits and detriments of RISC-based processors. My presentation touches on the topics of speed, architecture, cost, and applications.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also performed a benchmark of the Intel Pentium 4 (CISC) vs. a PowerPC CPU found in a Macintosh, the iBook G4 (RISC). Unfortunately, due to a lack of time, I cannot in good faith call the benchmark authoritative. The processors run at different clock speeds, and one of the results does not appear nominal, perhaps due to possible overhead stemming from the use of MinGW on Windows. Two algorithms and three languages were used. A triple integral over a sphere, and a SHA-256 hash of a large file. The integral program was tested in both C and FORTRAN 77. The SHA-256 was implemented in C++.
